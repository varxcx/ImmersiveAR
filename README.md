Welcome to Immersive AR! This project allows you to experience immersive augmented reality (AR) content on your iOS device.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Immersive AR:

### Prerequisites

- Xcode installed on your Mac
- An iOS device (AR features do not work in the simulator)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varxcx/ImmersiveAR.git
cd ImmersiveAR
```

### Build and Run

1. Open the `ImmersiveAR.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2. Connect your iOS device to your Mac.
3. Select your iOS device as the build target.
4. Click the "Run" button in Xcode to build and run the app on your device.

### AR Experience

1. Once the app is running on your device, hold your phone vertically and keep it steady.
